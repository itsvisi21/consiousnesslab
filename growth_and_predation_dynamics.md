#### **1. Observations:**
- **Prey Distribution (Green):**
  - Prey populations stabilize within capped limits, growing and spreading across the grid while constrained by carrying capacity.
- **Predator Distribution (Red):**
  - Predator populations stabilize near prey-rich areas, balancing growth and natural death rates.

#### **2. Successes:**
- **Numerical Stability Achieved:**
  - The simplified model successfully avoids numerical overflows by capping population values and removing diffusion terms.
- **Clear Population Dynamics:**
  - Prey and predator interactions are well-behaved, showing realistic growth and regulation.

#### **3. Next Steps:**
1. **Gradual Complexity Reintroduction:**
   - Reintroduce diffusion and hub dynamics step-by-step, ensuring stability at each stage.
2. **Analyze Temporal Trends:**
   - Generate time-series plots to visualize population changes over time for both prey and predators.
