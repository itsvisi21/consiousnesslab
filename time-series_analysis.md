#### **Observations:**
1. **Prey Population**:
   - Shows stable growth initially, followed by a gradual plateau as it reaches the carrying capacity.
   - Small oscillations occur due to predation.

2. **Predator Population**:
   - Initially follows prey growth, reflecting predator dependence on prey availability.
   - Stabilizes at a lower level, showing a natural balance between growth and death rates.

#### **Insights**:
- The model successfully demonstrates predator-prey dynamics, with realistic population stabilization.
- Oscillations indicate healthy ecosystem interactions without runaway growth or collapse.

Would you like to:
1. Reintroduce diffusion or hub dynamics gradually?
2. Further refine the simplified model or explore other dynamics?
