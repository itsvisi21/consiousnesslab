```
#### **1. Final Adaptive \( \Psi(C) \) with Economics and Migration (Purple)**
- Adaptive hubs respond to long-term economic strategies and dynamic migration patterns.

#### **2. Final Plant and Prey Distributions**
- **Plant Species 1 (Yellow-Green)**:
  - Resource optimization and trade adjustments stabilize plant distribution, reducing disparities.
- **Prey (Green)**:
  - Prey populations align with resource-abundant areas, influenced by stochastic and resource-driven migration.

#### **3. Final Predator Distribution (Red)**
- Predators stabilize near prey-rich zones, reflecting the combined effects of trade and migration.

#### **4. Final Trade-Adjusted Resources (Cool-Warm)**
- Resource redistribution through trade and economic incentives balances regional disparities, enhancing overall stability.

#### **5. Final Seasonal Carrying Capacity (Cool-Warm)**
- Seasonal variability impacts resource availability, requiring continual adaptation.

### **Key Observations**
1. **Economic Strategies**:
   - Long-term optimization and trade adjustments reduce resource disparities, stabilizing populations.
   - Economic incentives effectively redistribute resources from surplus to deficit regions.

2. **Migration Dynamics**:
   - Stochastic and resource-driven migration enhance adaptability, preventing overpopulation in resource-scarce areas.

3. **System Resilience**:
   - The integration of economic strategies and migration maintains ecosystem stability under complex and dynamic conditions.
